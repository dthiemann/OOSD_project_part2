To do for team #1 for OOSD project part 2

Tim - Checkpoint & Allocation
Joe - KeyStorage & ValueStorage
Dylan - LinearFileDatabase
Jason - DiskSpace, set up Unit Tests

3 files - one for two bit arrays (Allocate & Checkpoint), one for key/value, one for identifiers
We have decided to remove the Node class (for now) for our LinearFileDatabase.java class. We discussed and discovered a (potentially) better way to implement it.

DiskSpace will take in an extra parameter, fileName because we will be using 2 separate files for Keys and Identifiers 

11/4 Comment by Ted Herman -
 Each person should also have the names of the classes (or Java programs) 
they will be doing.  Also for Dylan: please "git add .project" and commit
so that the repository can be imported by Eclipse.
