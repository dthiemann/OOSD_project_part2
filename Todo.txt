To do for team #1 for OOSD project part 2

Tim - Checkpoint.java & Allocation.java
Joe - KeyStorage.java & ValueStorage.java (name may change)
Dylan - LinearFileDatabase.java - assisting with KeyStorage.java & ValueStorage.java
Jason - DiskSpace.java - also setting up UnitTests

**Updated** Description: Allocate 



3 files - one for two bit arrays (Allocate & Checkpoint), one for key/value, one for identifiers
We have decided to remove the Node class (for now) for our LinearFileDatabase.java class. We discussed and discovered a (potentially) better way to implement it.

DiskSpace will take in an extra parameter, fileName because we will be using 2 separate files for Keys and Identifiers

 Each person should also have the names of the classes (or Java programs) 
they will be doing.  Also for Dylan: please "git add .project" and commit
so that the repository can be imported by Eclipse.

Comment by Dylan -
	Added names of the classes. the .project file was already in the
repo. it was within the OOSD_project_part2 folder.
